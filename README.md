Detect counterfeit medicine using blockchain simulation
#  Medichain: Fighting Fake Medicine with Real Code

Hey there   
I'm Raj — and this is a project I’m building straight from the heart.

The goal?  
To simulate how **blockchain** can be used to detect **counterfeit medicine** in a supply chain.  
No Ethereum, no fancy frameworks — just pure logic, code, and a drive to solve something real.



##  Why This?

Fake medicine kills people.  
And a lot of the time, no one even realizes when something in the supply chain has been tampered with.  
So I asked myself:  
> *Can I build something that makes it obvious — even impossible — to mess with medicine data without being caught?*

This project is my answer to that.


##  What I’m Building

- A **custom blockchain** built in Python (no copy-paste magic)
- Each block holds real-looking medicine batch info (like ID, manufacturer, expiry, etc.)
- If *anything* is tampered with the chain breaks and my system throws a flag 
- I’m also adding a simple **HTML/CSS interface** later to view/submit medicine data




##  Project Roadmap

- [ done] Start the repo and commit my "why" 
- [ ] Build the `Block` and `Blockchain` classes from scratch
- [ ] Add hashing + tamper detection logic
- [ ] Store & simulate medicine batch data
- [ ] Optional UI: make a cute web viewer for blocks
- [ ] Final walkthrough + README polish



##  Tools & Tech

- Python 3 (core logic)
- SHA-256 (for hashing)
- HTML/CSS (for the fun frontend)
- Maybe Flask, maybe not — depends on time/feel


## What to Expect

If you scroll through this later:
- You’ll see **raw logic**, not just libraries
- Comments, breakdowns, decisions — **everything I understood**
- A few intentional mistakes and corrections too — because *I’m here to learn, not just impress*


##  Who’s Behind This?

I’m Rajeev Sharma — a CS student who tends to overthink, sometimes freeze, but still shows up anyway.  
This project is part of a larger journey where I’m learning how to push past fear, build cool stuff, and actually finish things that matter.

If you're reading this  thanks for being a part of that.
